This program implements a number guessing game using Scheme (R5RS, written using Racket). The player is asked to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Based on the player's input, the program determines and informs the user whether the target number is higher, lower, or the same as their guess. The program will continue to prompt the player until the correct guess is made. After each round, the player is asked for their name and the number of guesses it took to find the correct number is recorded. Players can opt to play again or quit.
